### Again, deliverables for this lab are: 

1. Videos of you controlling the wheels with your joystick controller properly.

2. Three ideas on how to use controllers' rumble feature for Wizard of Oz.
- When the robot is getting close to people, the joystick can rumble to alert
- When the robot is doing a task such as opening a drawer, we can use the frequency of the rumble to indicate correct action (one rumble) or wrong action (two rumbles)
- When the WoZ user is controlling a robot, we can also send a rumble to alert that the robot's battery is critically low.
