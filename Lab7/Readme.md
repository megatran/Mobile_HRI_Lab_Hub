# Interact with with people + chatty robot


**List the names and NetID for your partners here.**


In this lab, let's try out some moves with our robots and make them talk!


## Prep
If you haven't finished your robot chassis, try to wrap it up in this lab.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Your laptop
2. Your hoverbot
3. Speaker (Will arrive later this week, I will make a post when they arrive. I have two for now.)


### Deliverables for this lab are:


1. A sketch of your robot interacting with people
2. A video of your robot acting out the interaction in item 1.
3. A sketch of your robot interacting with people through motion and voice
4. A video of your robot acting out the interaction in item 3.




## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:


A) [Interact with People](#part-a-interact-with-people)


B) [Let's Chat](#part-b-let's-chat)


Labs are due on Tuesdays after Spring break. Make sure this page is linked to your main class hub page.


## Part A. Interact with People
Based on your final project proposal, sketch out one possible interaction scenario with your robot. The robot must interact with at least one person. Then, act it out with your robot through WoZ. (Remember to take a video.)

Be mindful of the others around you. Be safe.


## Part B. Let's Chat
Again, sketch out one possible scenario with your robot. But this time, add a short conversation between the robot and humans. Act it out again. (Remember to take a video.)


To make the robot talk, plugin your speaker.


``` bash
# In a RPi terminal
sudo apt-get install espeak
```


``` bash
# espeak "text-you-want-your-robot-to-say"
espeak "Hello"
espeak "how are you"
```


You can also change the speed and pitch of the voice. Check out the instructions [here](https://espeak.sourceforge.net/commands.html).


### Again, the deliverables for this lab are:


1. A sketch of your robot interacting with people
2. A video of your robot acting out the interaction in your sketch
3. A sketch of your robot interacting with people through motion and voice
4. A video of your robot acting out the interaction in your sketch
