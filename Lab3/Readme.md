# Make the Robot Move
**List the names and NetID for your partners here.**

In this week's lab, you will lay the foundations for your mobile robot. We will control commercially available hoverboards (Dr. Ju bought these on eBay) with ODrive motor controllers. This week's lab can be challenging. Be prepared to get your hands dirty.


## Prep

Starting with this lab, form a group of 3 to 4 people (doesn't have to be the same group as in previous labs). You will work with the same team until the end of the semester.

### Before Thursday, please watch/read the following video/websites.
[Beginner's Guide on Soldering](https://www.makerspaces.com/how-to-solder/)

[How to Solder Wires Together](https://youtu.be/NSqPHQ1zQco)


### For this lab, you will need:
1.  laptop
2.  strength to take things apart

### For students in Ithaca
Please bring all items I have shipped to you to the robotics lab in Upson. You will need both the raspberry pi and the hoverboards.
- Use the [RPi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to write [class image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMWyJUoA-CJ73vktrp3nPKiykwzOaauU/view?usp=sharing) to the SD cards (You will need to flash one card per group). [Online Guide](https://howchoo.com/pi/raspberry-pi-imager#write-a-custom-image). Please do this before Thursday's lab.

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
0. a video showing that you can control the hoverboard through python
1. three sketches of potential robots you can build with this platform. Be more realistic and think of these sketches as a potential candidate for your final project. (Look around, what can you automate?)

### The Report 
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above).
